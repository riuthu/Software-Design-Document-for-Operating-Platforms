# Software-Design-Document-for-Operating-Platforms
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wants a web version of the game called "Draw it or Lose it." The game requires support for multiple teams playing for different rounds. Each team guesses a rendering picture while it's being revealed, and the game has specific time frames for guesses. The app needs to be available on the web and provide an engaging experience for multiple teams at one time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The documentation provides a clear overview of the client's requirements and it identifies design constraints, including platform consistency, scalability, and uniqueness of usernames. The document outlines the system architecture, domain model, and development requirements for various platforms.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The document outlines specific requirements and constraints, allowing me to have a clear understanding of the project requirements and limitations. It also provides insights into platform compatibility, memory management, security considerations, and distribution methods.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One potential area for improvement is providing more detailed information about security measures. This could include discussing encryption techniques, secure communication protocols, and user authentication mechanisms.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are interpreted by clearly defining gameplay mechanics, compatible platforms, server side requirements, and architecture.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The approach involves assessing different operating platforms (Mac, Linux, Windows, mobile) based on factors like cost, scalability, and technical expertise. The document also emphasizes the importance of using appropriate development tools for each platform and outlines advantages and disadvantages for each choice.
